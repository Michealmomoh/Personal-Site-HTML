        <p> Overall the top ten systems meet the needs of 90% of the institutions surveyed. However, the popularity of individual solutions varies with ‘institutional size’, which we measured by student enrolment as the data is readily available.</p> 
        <p>All members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical standards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University values integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness and strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business practices.</p>
      <p>Michaelson recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Michaelson must strive at all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.</p>
